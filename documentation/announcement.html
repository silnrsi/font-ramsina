    <p>We are very pleased to announce the release of Ramsina, a new
    font for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The font name,
    Ramsina, is a pure Assyrian name for females adored by many. The
    emphasis is on the second syllable: rahm-SEE-nah.</p>
    <p>The font was designed as a revival, or facsimile, of metal type
    cut in India from around 1920.</p>
    <p>This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East
    Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of the <a
    href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font License</a>.</p>
    <p>Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single,
    all-platforms package on the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/download">Download
    page</a>.</p>
