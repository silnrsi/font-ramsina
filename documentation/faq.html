    <h4 id="how-is-this-font-different-from-east-syriac-marcus"><em>How
    is this font different from East Syriac Marcus?</em></h4>
    <p>This font was based on the design of the Syriac characters in
    East Syriac Marcus. The outlines have been cleaned up or redrawn.
    The Latin characters were imported from Crimson Pro. The font has
    support for ligatures and diacritics that the East Syriac style
    requires. This font was updated to use a more modern build system so
    that it can be easily updated in the future.</p>
