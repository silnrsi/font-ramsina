    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Ramsina:</p>
    <h4 id="how-is-this-font-different-from-east-syriac-marcus"><em>How
    is this font different from East Syriac Marcus?</em></h4>
    <p>This font was based on the design of the Syriac characters in
    East Syriac Marcus. The outlines have been cleaned up or redrawn.
    The Latin characters were imported from Crimson Pro. The font has
    added support for ligatures and diacritics that the East Syriac
    style requires. This font was updated to use a more modern build
    system so that it can be easily updated in the future.</p>
    <p>In addition, the design of two characters, U+0738 (dotted zlama
    horizontal) and U+0739 (dotted zlama angular), have been swapped to
    follow the Unicode Standard design. U+0740 (feminine dot) has been
    reverted to use the single dot, and U+0324 (diaeresis below) was
    added to support the double dot below.</p>
    <h4 id="why-does-the-bold-weight-look-so-fuzzy"><em>Why does the
    Bold weight look so fuzzy?</em></h4>
    <p>Because Idiqlat is already quite heavy, it does not come with a
    Bold weight. If you tried to turn on Bold using the application’s UI
    controls such as a “B” button you will get what is called “fake”
    Bold. This will not look good. It would be better to choose a
    lighter weight, to use underlining, or to choose another font in
    order to show emphasis.</p>
    <h3
    id="i-notice-that-this-font-is-missing-0727-syriac-letter-reversed-pe-and-the-characters-from-the-syriac-supplement-block-0860..086f.-will-you-add-them"><em>I
    notice that this font is missing 0727 SYRIAC LETTER REVERSED PE and
    the characters from the Syriac Supplement block (0860..086F). Will
    you add them?</em></h3>
    <p>This font supports the East Syriac style of writing.</p>
    <p>SYRIAC LETTER REVERSED PE is only used in Christian Palestinian
    Aramaic which uses a significantly different style of writing
    Syriac. Thus, we chose not to include that character since there are
    no samples of usage in the East Syriac style.</p>
    <p>It does not appear that Garshuni Malayalam (the characters from
    the Syriac Supplement block) uses the East Syriac style of
    writing.</p>
    <p>In addition, we do not plan to add additional support to this
    font with the exception of minor bug fixes.</p>
