    <p>Ramsina is a font family for the East Syriac script. The font was
    designed as a revival, or facsimile, of metal type cut in India from
    around 1920.</p>
    <p>This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East
    Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of the <a
    href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font License</a>.</p>
    <p>The Latin glyphs were imported from Crimson Pro.</p>
    <p>One font from this typeface family is included in the
    <em>Ramsina</em> release:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ramsina Regular</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Type samples showing some of the inventory of glyphs can be found
    here: <a href="sample.html">Ramsina Type Sample</a>.</p>
