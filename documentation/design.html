    <p>Ramsina is a font family for the East Syriac script. The font was
    designed as a revival, or facsimile, of metal type cut in India from
    around 1920.</p>
    <p>This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East
    Syriac Marcus.</p>
    <p>The Latin glyphs were imported from Crimson Pro.</p>
    <p>One font from this typeface family is included in the
    <em>Ramsina</em> release:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ramsina Regular</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SIL Global is the creator of the Ramsina fonts, and is the owner
    of all proprietary rights therein.</p>
