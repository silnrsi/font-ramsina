Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Ramsina:

#### *How is this font different from East Syriac Marcus?*

This font was based on the design of the Syriac characters in East Syriac Marcus. The outlines have been cleaned up or redrawn. The Latin characters were imported from Crimson Pro. The font has added support for ligatures and diacritics that the East Syriac style requires. This font was updated to use a more modern build system so that it can be easily updated in the future.

#### *Why does the Bold weight look so fuzzy?*

Because Idiqlat is already quite heavy, it does not come with a Bold weight. If you tried to turn on Bold using the application’s UI controls such as a “B” button you will get what is called “fake” Bold. This will not look good. It would be better to choose a lighter weight, to use underlining, or to choose another font in order to show emphasis.

### *I notice that this font is missing 0727 SYRIAC LETTER REVERSED PE and the characters from the Syriac Supplement block (0860..086F). Will you add them?*

This font supports the East Syriac style of writing. 

SYRIAC LETTER REVERSED PE is only used in Christian Palestinian Aramaic which uses a significantly different style of writing Syriac. Thus, we chose not to include that character since there are no samples of usage in the East Syriac style.

It does not appear that Garshuni Malayalam (the characters from the Syriac Supplement block) uses the East Syriac style of writing.

In addition, we do not plan to add additional support to this font with the exception of minor bug fixes.
