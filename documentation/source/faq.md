Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Ramsina:

#### *How is this font different from East Syriac Marcus?*

This font was based on the design of the Syriac characters in East Syriac Marcus. The outlines have been cleaned up or redrawn. The Latin characters were imported from Crimson Pro. The font has added support for ligatures and diacritics that the East Syriac style requires. This font was updated to use a more modern build system so that it can be easily updated in the future.

In addition, the design of two characters, U+0738 (dotted zlama horizontal) and U+0739 (dotted zlama angular), have been swapped to follow the Unicode Standard design. U+0740 (feminine dot) has been reverted to use the single dot, and U+0324 (diaeresis below) was added to support the double dot below.

#### *Why does the Bold weight look so fuzzy?*

Because Ramsina is already quite heavy, it does not come with a Bold weight. If you tried to turn on Bold using the application’s UI controls such as a “B” button you will get what is called “fake” Bold. This will not look good. It would be better to choose a lighter weight, to use underlining, or to choose another font in order to show emphasis.

### *I notice that this font is missing 072D..072F, 074D..074F, and the characters from the Syriac Supplement block (0860..086F). Will you add them?*

This font supports the East Syriac style of writing. No examples of those characters are provided in the East Syriac style.

In addition, we do not plan to add additional support to this font with the exception of minor bug fixes.
