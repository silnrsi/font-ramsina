    <p>The EastSyriacMarcusNew font supports the East Syriac style of
    the Syriac script. The font was designed as a facsimile based on
    metal type cut in India from around 1920.</p>
    <p>This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East
    Syriac Marcus.</p>
    <p>The Latin glyphs were imported from Crimson Pro.</p>
    <p>One font from this typeface family is included in the
    <em>EastSyriacMarcusNew</em> release:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>EastSyriacMarcusNew Regular</li>
    </ul>
