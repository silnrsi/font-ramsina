We are very pleased to announce the release of Ramsina, a new font for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The font name, Ramsina, is a pure Assyrian name for females adored by many. The emphasis is on the second syllable: rahm-SEE-nah.

The font was designed as a revival, or facsimile, of metal type cut in India from around 1920.

This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/).

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download page](https://software.sil.org/scheherazade/download).
