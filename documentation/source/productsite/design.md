Ramsina is a font family for the East Syriac script. The font was designed as a revival, or facsimile, of metal type cut in India from around 1920.

This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East Syriac Marcus.

The Latin glyphs were imported from Crimson Pro.

One font from this typeface family is included in the *Ramsina* release:

* Ramsina Regular
